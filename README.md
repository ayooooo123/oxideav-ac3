Pure-Rust **AC-3 (Dolby Digital)** + **E-AC-3 (Enhanced AC-3 / Dolby
Digital Plus)** audio decoder + encoder — elementary streams per
ATSC A/52:2018 (= ETSI TS 102 366). Zero C dependencies.

Part of the [oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace)
framework but usable standalone.

## Architecture

The pipeline follows the spec's natural ordering; each module owns one
slice of §5..§7 (base AC-3) or §E (E-AC-3):

1. [`syncinfo`] — sync word 0x0B77, crc1, fscod, frmsizecod,
   frame-length lookup (§5.3.1 / §5.4.1 / Table 5.18).
2. [`bsi`] — Bit Stream Information: bsid, bsmod, acmod → channel layout
   + lfeon + dialnorm + the optional timecode / Annex D alternate-syntax
   metadata blocks (§5.4.2).
3. [`audblk`] — per-block exponent decode (§7.1), parametric bit
   allocation (§7.2 with §7.2.2.6 delta-bit-allocation), mantissa decode
   (§7.3), channel coupling (§7.4), rematrixing (§7.5), dynamic-range
   compression (§7.7).
4. [`imdct`] + [`mdct`] — §7.9.4 FFT-backed 512-point IMDCT and
   256-point short-block pair, plus the forward transforms the encoder
   uses.
5. [`downmix`] — §7.8 LoRo + §7.8.2 LtRt downmix matrices for every
   source acmod, with Annex D / E-AC-3 mix-level extension routing.
6. [`wave_order`] — channel reorder for front-centre-bearing layouts
   (`acmod ∈ {3, 5, 7}`).
7. [`encoder`] — base AC-3 encoder.
8. [`eac3`] — Annex E decoder + encoder, including opt-in JOC/OAMD
   object reconstruction and stereo speaker rendering.
9. [`crc`] — §7.10.1 CRC-16 over poly 0x8005, shared between the encoder
   and the opt-in `decoder::verify_packet_crc` residue check.
10. [`drc`] — §6.1.9 / §7.6 / §7.7 dynamic-range-control + dialogue-
    normalisation control surface (`DrcSettings`: partial-compression
    cut/boost, heavy-compression "RF mode", dialnorm playback target).

## Capabilities

### Default decoder: FFmpeg's, ported

The decoder the codec registry installs for `"ac3"` and `"eac3"`
(`decoder::make_decoder` / `make_eac3_decoder`) is a port of FFmpeg's
float AC-3 / E-AC-3 decoder at commit 2da55bf (`libavcodec/ac3dec.c`,
`eac3dec.c`, their tables and DSP; `src/ffdec`, LGPL-2.1-or-later). For the
packets FFmpeg's demuxer gives its own decoder it emits FFmpeg's frames:
the same count and sizes, the same channel layout and order, planar
`F32P` reported through `Decoder::output_audio_format`, and samples
within 139-140 dB SNR of FFmpeg's C code paths (`-cpuflags 0`) on every
FATE `ac3/` and `eac3/` stream. That includes FFmpeg's dither and
spectral-extension noise (its `AVLFG` seeded with 0), concealment of a cut
or undecodable frame (the previous frame's last block, repeated), packets
holding several frames, and E-AC-3 dependent substreams (7.1). Not ported:
the decoder options `downmix`, `drc_scale`, `heavy_compr`, `target_level`
and `cons_noisegen` (their defaults are what runs).

### Native AC-3 decoder

The crate's own decoder stays behind the opt-in factories
(`decoder::make_native_decoder`, `make_decoder_ltrt`,
`make_decoder_with_drc`, `make_eac3_decoder_with_joc`): interleaved S16,
downmixed to the container's channel count. What it covers:

- Sync frame + BSI parse (§5.3 / §5.4). All §5.4.2 metadata words —
  bit-stream mode, compression gain, dialogue normalisation, mix
  levels, Dolby Surround mode, timecodes, copyright/original flags,
  language code, audio-production info, the Annex D alternate-syntax
  informational blocks, and the `addbsi` trailer — are parsed and
  surfaced as typed accessors (advisory metadata; the PCM path is
  unchanged).
- Audio-block parse (§5.4.3), exponent decode (§7.1) + parametric bit
  allocation (§7.2), mantissa decode (§7.3) with bap=0 dither (§7.3.4),
  delta bit allocation (§7.2.2.6).
- IMDCT synthesis (§7.9) — both 512-point long-block and 256-point
  short-block paths.
- Channel coupling (§7.4) + rematrix (§7.5) + dynrng (§7.7).
- **Dynamic-range-control + dialogue-normalisation control surface**
  (§6.1.9 / §7.6 / §7.7, [`drc`]). The mandatory §7.7.1 full-`dynrng`
  decode is the default ("line out"); a listener-facing
  [`DrcSettings`] steers the §7.7.1.2 *partial-compression* cut/boost
  factors (apply a fraction of each gain reduction / increase, with
  independent directions), §7.7.2 *heavy compression* ("RF mode" —
  substitutes the BSI `compr` word, ±48 dB, falling back to `dynrng`
  when a frame carries no `compr` per §7.7.2.1), and §7.6 dialogue
  normalisation (an opt-in playback scalar `10^((target − dialnorm)/20)`
  toward a chosen headroom target). Build a configured decoder with
  `decoder::make_decoder_with_drc(params, DrcSettings)`. Applies to both
  the AC-3 and E-AC-3 paths.
- Downmix (§7.8) — LoRo and LtRt 2-channel.
- Bitstream → WAV channel reorder for multichannel layouts.

### AC-3 encoder

- Multichannel encode — 1/0, 2/0, 2/0+LFE (2.1), 3/0, 2/2, 3/2, 3/2.1
  (5.1) and other acmod layouts, with a per-channel exponent refresh
  cadence + D15/D25/D45 strategy elected by measured bit cost
  (§7.1.3 — every anchor set bounds the blocks that reuse it), 5-fbw
  channel coupling within the §5.4.3.12 narrow-coupling validity
  envelope, a §8.2.2 transient detector (4th-order Butterworth 8 kHz
  split; all fbw channels switch together, dither defeated on the
  switched block and the next per §8.2.9), all seven LFE bins coded
  (§7.1.3 `lfeendmant = 7`), per-channel `fsnroffst[ch]` tuning
  (§5.4.3.40), per-block SNR-offset bit-pool redistribution, the
  §7.2.2.1.1 all-zero-offset special case mirrored in the allocator,
  and §7.10.1 dual-CRC emission.
- **Bitstream-metadata surface** (`encoder::MetadataParams` /
  `make_encoder_with_metadata`, or the registry options `dialnorm`,
  `compr`, `dynrng`, `bsmod`, `cmixlev`, `surmixlev`, `dsurmod`,
  `langcod`, `mixlevel`+`roomtyp`, `copyright`, `origbs`): every
  §5.4.2 BSI advisory word plus the §5.4.3.3-4 per-block `dynrng`
  dynamic-range word. Round-tripped through the typed `bsi::parse`
  surface and black-box validated: the external decoder binary
  reproduces the authored `dynrng` / `compr` gains exactly
  (Δ0.000 dB at −12 dB words) and a 10 dB `dialnorm` delta measures
  −10.03 dB under target-level normalisation.

### E-AC-3 (Annex E)

- Decoder — BSI, audfrm (Tables E1.2 / E1.3), audblk DSP, the §3.4
  Adaptive Hybrid Transform on fbw / LFE / coupling channels, §3.6
  spectral extension with the §3.6.4.2.3 SPXATTEN border notch, and
  §3.7.2 transient pre-noise processing. All three §2.3.2.3 SNR-offset
  strategies decode: the frame-level `snroffststr == 0` pair plus the
  §2.3.3.27 per-block modes `0x1` (one shared `blkfsnroffst`) and `0x2`
  (independent per-coupling/channel/LFE fine offsets), each gated by the
  per-block `snroffste` reuse flag. Enhanced coupling
  (`ecplinu == 1`, §E.2.3.3.16-26 / §E.3.5.5) decodes end-to-end: the
  audblk parser reads the strategy + per-channel amplitude/angle/chaos
  coordinates, decodes the enhanced-coupling channel through the shared
  exponent / bit-allocation / mantissa path, and a deferred second pass
  reconstructs the non-aliased complex carrier `Z[k]` from the
  previous / current / next blocks (§E.3.5.5.1), processes the per-bin
  amplitudes + de-correlated angles, and emits each coupled channel's
  transform coefficients via the §E.3.5.5.4 complex product — replacing
  the standard §7.4 decouple. Block 0's "previous block" carrier source
  is threaded across the frame boundary from the prior frame's last
  enhanced-coupling block (carried on `EcplState`, §E.3.5.5.1), so the
  prior-frame edge no longer collapses to a zero carrier; the frame's
  last block's "next block" still uses a zero carrier (it lives in a
  not-yet-decoded frame — streaming lookahead is out of scope). Three
  enhanced-coupling conformance defects fixed in r406, pinned by the
  new encoder round-trips: `chincpl[ch]` is read directly after
  `ecplinu` (BEFORE the standard/enhanced strategy split — the prior
  order desynced every multichannel ecpl frame, invisibly in 2/0 where
  the flags are implicit); `ecplparam1e/2e == 0` now REUSE the
  previously transmitted amplitudes / angle+chaos values per
  §2.3.3.21-22 (previously each block's coordinate set was replaced
  wholesale, silencing every band of a reusing channel); and the
  resolved banding structure masks its entries up to and including
  `max(ecpl_begin_subbnd, 8)` per §E.2.3.3.19 — the Table E2.14
  default carries a merge bit at sub-band 9, so a default-banded
  region beginning there previously made `necplbnd` disagree with the
  §E.3.5.5.1 band walk by one band (a coordinate-count desync). The
  §E.3.3.2 `nrematbd` derivation now folds in enhanced coupling: a 2/0
  `ecplinu` block sizes its rematrix-flag field from the raw `ecplbegf`
  code (0/1/2/<5 → 0/1/2/3 bands, else 4) rather than `cplbegf`, keeping
  the bit cursor aligned on enhanced-coupling 2/0 frames. Standard coupling
  now applies the §E.2.3.3.15 **default coupling banding structure**
  (`defcplbndstrc[]`, Table E2.12, indexed by absolute sub-band) when
  `cplbndstrce == 0` in a frame's first coupling block, instead of leaving
  every sub-band un-merged — the prior all-zeros behaviour collapsed a
  7-subband region to 7 bands instead of 3, corrupting the §7.4
  coupling-coordinate scatter on every basic stereo-coupled frame. Three
  corpus stereo fixtures (`eac3-stereo-48000-192kbps`, `eac3-256-coeff-block`,
  `eac3-from-ac3-bitstream-recombination`) jumped from ~8-14 dB to ~91 dB
  PSNR and are now CI-gated at an 80 dB floor (`Tier::MinPsnr` in
  `tests/docs_corpus.rs`). Dependent-substream channel combination follows
  the §E.3.8.2 replace-or-extend rule: each dep coded channel is routed by
  its Table E2.5 location (or natural `acmod` order when `chanmape == 0`),
  *replacing* the matching independent-substream channel in place when the
  location is shared (e.g. a dep substream re-coding Center / LFE, or L/R
  via a custom `chanmap`) and *extending* the output only for genuinely new
  locations — so a real greater-than-5.1 broadcast program reassembles
  spatially correctly rather than duplicating and decorrelating the shared
  channels a blind append would have appended.
  Real-broadcast decode conformance (issue #13): three audblk/audfrm
  bit-accounting defects behind the reported "uncorrelated output +
  second-long dropouts" class are fixed — the Table E1.4 NEGATIVE
  derived `cplendf` when SPX and standard coupling are co-active with
  `spxbegf < 2` (formerly clamped at 0, over-reading up to two coupling
  sub-bands and desyncing the rest of the block), the §2.3.2.27
  `blkstrtinfo` width (16-bit words through ceiling-log2, formerly
  frame bits through floor-log2+1), and the per-block `fgaincod`
  default reset. The class is pinned by hand-written spec-conformant
  syncframes (SPX + coupling co-active — a geometry no available
  encoder produces) that ffmpeg accepts and both decoders agree on at
  ~92 dB, by a decode-side ffmpeg conformance harness
  (`tests/eac3_decode_ffmpeg.rs`: ffmpeg-generated streams across
  rates/modes/coupling/metadata + our-encoder broadcast BSI shapes,
  ≥ 50 dB per channel), and by an env-gated local-vector gate
  (`OXIDEAV_AC3_LOCAL_EAC3=/path` runs the same PSNR gate on captures
  that cannot be committed). Zero-fill fallbacks are now countable via
  `Eac3DecoderState::frames_zero_filled`, so callers can tell decoder
  dropouts from silent program audio.
- **Opt-in JOC object presentation**
  (`decoder::make_eac3_decoder_with_joc`) parses EC-3 Extension Type A
  and EMDF metadata from declared E-AC-3 skip fields, reconstructs up to
  16 object signals with the TS 103 420 sparse/QMF pipeline, applies
  dynamic OAMD updates, and renders a stereo speaker presentation. The
  existing decoder factories retain their compatibility downmix, and the
  opt-in decoder falls back to that path on absent, malformed, or
  unsupported metadata. This is a standards-derived speaker renderer,
  not Dolby's proprietary binaural/headphone renderer; encoding JOC is
  outside its scope.
- Encoder — independent + dependent substream pairs for 1.0 / 2.0 / 5.1
  / 7.1 layouts, with adaptive / frame-based exponent strategies,
  fractional syncframes (§E.2.3.1.5 — see below) and the §3.7
  transient-pre-noise-processing emission (see below).
  **Bitstream-metadata surface** (`eac3::Eac3Metadata` /
  `eac3::make_encoder_with_metadata` + registry options): fixed-BSI
  `dialnorm` and `compr`, the per-block `dynrng` word (every block of
  every substream), the Table E1.2 **mixing-metadata block**
  (`dmixmod`, LtRt/LoRo centre + surround mix levels, `lfemixlevcod`,
  `pgmscl`, `extpgmscl`) and the §E.2.3.1.62+ **informational block**
  (`bsmod`, copyright/original, 2/0 `dsurmod`+`dheadphonmod`,
  ≥6-channel `dsurexmod`, audio-production info, `sourcefscod`) —
  emitted on the independent substream (a 7.1 pair's dependent
  substream keeps the blocks absent while sharing dialnorm/compr).
  Round-tripped through the typed Annex E `bsi::parse` surface (which
  now also surfaces `bsmod`); black-box validated: the external
  decoder binary accepts the block-bearing syntax (decode level
  within 0.004 dB of a block-less encode) and reproduces the authored
  `dynrng` gain exactly. Metadata-bearing AC-3 and E-AC-3 streams are
  swept through the corruption families in `tests/robustness.rs`.
  **Spectral extension is now available on the encoder side**
  (`eac3::make_encoder_with_spx(params, SpxParams)`, §E.2.3.3 / §E.3.6):
  every fbw channel is coded only up to the SPX begin frequency
  (default tc# 109 ≈ 10.2 kHz at 48 kHz) and the decoder regenerates
  the extension region (default up to tc# 229 ≈ 21.5 kHz) from a
  translated copy of the channel's own low band, noise-blended and
  scaled by per-band coordinates the encoder derives from the
  §3.6.4.3 energy-matching rule (`spxco = rms(original HF band) /
  (rms(translated band)·32)`, quantised through the §E.2.3.3.11-13
  exponent/mantissa/master-coordinate forms). Coordinates refresh on
  the exponent anchor blocks and are reused between (`spxcoe`);
  geometry (begin/end/copy-start codes, noise blend, default
  Table E2.11 vs explicit band structure) is configurable via
  `SpxParams`; the freed high-frequency bits are re-spent on the coded
  low band by the SNR-offset tuner. Optional extras: §3.6.4.2.3
  **attenuation** (`spxattene`/`chinspxatten`/`spxattencod` in audfrm,
  with the border/wrap notch folded into the encoder's coordinate
  computation so band energies still match) and **adaptive copy-start**
  (per-frame `spxstrtf` re-selection that scores every candidate by
  coordinate saturation — a spectrum with a hole above the first copy
  sub-band would otherwise pin a band's coordinate at the 0.875
  ceiling). Validated three ways: in-tree round-trips gate per-SPX-band
  decoded energy within ±3 dB of the original (mono / stereo / 5.1 /
  narrow non-default geometry), default-vs-explicit band structure
  decodes bit-identically, and an external decoder binary
  cross-validates the emitted syntax + banded energies (±4 dB) for the
  plain, mono, and attenuated variants. SPX-encoded streams are also
  swept through the truncation / bit-flip / garbage corruption
  families. Both entry points build the same encoder: the typed
  `make_encoder_with_spx` and the registry path via
  `CodecParameters::options` `spx*` keys (`spx`, `spx_begf`/`endf`/
  `strtf`/`blnd`, `spx_atten`, `spx_adaptive_copy_start`,
  `spx_explicit_band_structure`) — pinned byte-identical. Stationary
  coordinate refreshes are thrifted (`spxcoe = 0`) with a mid-frame
  level-step gate proving per-span refresh still tracks moving spectra.
  **Mixed per-channel membership** (§E.2.3.3.3) is supported via
  `SpxParams::channel_mask` / the `spx_chmask` option: excluded
  channels emit `chinspx[ch] = 0`, keep their `chbwcod`, and are
  waveform-coded to full bandwidth while member channels stop at the
  SPX begin frequency — the SNR tuner budgets every channel at its own
  coded bandwidth (per-channel `end_mant` plumbed through
  `tune_snroffst_with_plan_ends` / `overhead_bits_for_ends` /
  `mantissa_bits_total_ends`). The mixed split is validated in-tree
  (SPX band-energy contract on the member channel AND full-bandwidth
  HF fidelity on the excluded one) and through the external decoder.

  **The Adaptive Hybrid Transform is now on the encoder side too**
  (`eac3::make_encoder_with_aht(params)` / the `aht` option, §3.4):
  every fbw channel — and the LFE (`lfeahtinu`) — moves to a single
  block-0 exponent anchor (`nchregs[ch] == nlferegs == 1`, per-bin
  6-block-max exponents), long transforms are forced, and block 0
  front-loads the §3.4.4 mantissa stream: `chgaqmod` + gain words +
  per-bin codewords against the §3.4.3.1 `hebap[]` (the shared
  psd/excitation/mask pipeline with the Table E3.1 pointer table).
  Quantiser stack per Tables E3.2/E3.5/E3.6: minimum-Euclidean-
  distance VQ over Tables E4.1..E4.7 for `hebap` 1..7, and
  gain-adaptive quantisation for `hebap` >= 8 — the per-channel
  `gaqmod` (all four Table E3.3 modes, incl. the 5-bit composite gain
  triplets) is chosen by exact bit accounting, with per-bin Gk in
  {1, 2, 4} splitting short small-mantissa codewords from
  tag + dead-zone large escapes. The SNR-offset tuner costs AHT
  channels by their exact front-loaded payload and binary-searches
  the monotone `csnroffst·16 + fsnroffst` axis. Measured on a
  stationary stereo two-tone (in-tree decode): 42.0 dB @ 96 kbps
  rising to 75.6 dB @ 448 kbps. (Those r390 numbers were read against
  a standard path that clipped every reuse block's mantissas and sat
  at ~24 dB; with the r457 exponent-sharing bound the standard path
  codes the same fixture 2-23 dB *above* AHT — AHT rate-distortion
  tuning is a recorded follow-up, see "Equal-rate position".)
  Black-box: mono / stereo / 5.1 AHT streams decode through an
  external decoder binary at 28.1 / 28.1 / 33.4 dB.
  `examples/eac3_rate_curves.rs` prints the full
  standard/AHT/SPX/enhanced-coupling rate ladder;
  `aht_quality_scales_with_rate` gates the curve shape in CI.

  **Enhanced coupling is now on the encoder side too**
  (`eac3::make_encoder_with_ecpl(params, EcplParams)` / the `ecpl`,
  `ecpl_begf`, `ecpl_endf` options; §E.2.3.3.16-26 / §E.3.5.5) — the
  last Annex E encoder tool. Every fbw channel of the independent
  substream is coupled: below the begin frequency (default tc# 37 ≈
  3.5 kHz) channels are waveform-coded as usual; above it a single
  shared **carrier** channel is coded through the standard coupling-
  channel exponent / bit-allocation / mantissa path (cplexpstr anchors
  on blocks 0/3, `cplabsexp` + D15 groups, implicit first-block
  `cplleake` with zero leak inits, mantissas interleaved after the
  first coupled channel) and each coupled channel is rebuilt from it
  via per-band Table E3.10 amplitude + Table E3.11 angle coordinates
  (chaos 0, `ecpltrans` 0 — deterministic decode). The carrier is the
  first coupled channel's MDCT scaled per band ~3 dB above the loudest
  coupled channel — phase-locked to channel 0, whose angle is
  spec-fixed to 0 and never transmitted, with the margin letting the
  1.0 amplitude ceiling absorb band-level carrier coding loss.
  Coordinates are measured in the §E.3.5.5.1 complex analysis domain
  against the carrier the decoder will actually reconstruct (each bin
  through the final exponent + bap quantiser; the previous frame's
  carried quantised last block at the frame head, zero after the
  tail), refreshed on blocks 0/3 with §2.3.3.21-22 reuse thrift when
  the block-3 refresh quantises identically. **Chaos coordinates**
  (Table E3.12, on by default via `EcplParams::chaos` / the
  `ecpl_chaos` option) are derived from the measured per-band
  coherence — the incoherent fraction maps onto the 8-step grid,
  engaging the decoder's §E.3.5.5.3 per-bin random de-correlation for
  content the shared carrier cannot represent, with the transmitted
  amplitude pre-divided by the decoder's `1 + 0.38·chaosval`
  modification (chaos backs off when the pre-compensated amplitude
  would exceed the 1.0 ceiling — band energy wins over width). A
  partial-coherence stereo fixture gates the effect: decoded
  in-region inter-channel coherence 0.914 chaos-less → 0.796 with
  chaos (source 0.706), band energies still matched. Validated in-tree:
  stereo band-energy round-trip (±3 dB per signal band, ±1.5 dB coded
  low band, 20 dB waveform floor), a stereo **quadrature** fixture
  (channel 1's tones 90° off the carrier — pins the angle path at an
  18 dB waveform floor; a broken angle path collapses to ~3 dB),
  5.1 with explicit `chincpl` bits, a 7.1 indep(coupled)+dep(plain)
  pair walk, registry-vs-typed byte-identical construction, and the
  corruption families in `tests/robustness.rs`. Measured interior
  PSNR 25.4-30.4 dB across channels. Black-box cross-validation is
  **not possible for this tool**: the external validator binary
  reports enhanced coupling as not implemented and mutes (probed
  r406) — our decoder is ahead of the validator here, so validation
  is round-trip + spec-text only. **SPX and enhanced coupling can be
  co-active** (`make_encoder_with_spx_ecpl` / options `spx=1` +
  `ecpl=1`) per §3.6.1: channels are waveform-coded below the
  coupling begin, carried by the shared carrier + coordinates from
  there to the SPX begin frequency (the coupling region is
  SPX-bounded — `ecplendf` is not transmitted, §E.2.3.3.17), and
  SPX-synthesized above it; a stereo three-region round-trip gates
  all three regions' energies (coupling bands ±3 dB, SPX bands
  ±3.5 dB, coded low band ±1.5 dB). AHT remains mutually exclusive
  with both.

  Three spec-fidelity notes from this work: (1) GAQ dequantisation now
  uses the literal Table E3.5/E3.6 characteristics — the `Gk = 2`
  large mantissa is an `(m-1)`-bit codeword (2^(m-1) output points),
  and all scalar quantisers apply the exact Q15 `y = x + ax + b`
  remap. (2) The §3.4.5 IDCT's printed leading constant `2` measures
  as `√2` against an independent production decoder (a pure-DC and a
  40 Hz-modulated fixture both fit `external = ours(2·Σ)/√2` with
  ~89 dB residual); with `√2` the DC basis weight is exactly 1, and
  both transforms follow the deployed constant. (3) §E.3.5.5.1's
  step-3 overlap-add omits the §7.9.4.1 step-6 headroom-restoring
  factor of 2 (step 2 references only "steps 1 to 5") — taken
  literally the analysis→synthesis chain returns exactly half the
  original coefficients, so every enhanced-coupling channel would
  decode 6 dB low and the loudest coupled channel would need the
  unrepresentable amplitude 2.0; the Table E3.10 ceiling of exactly
  1.0 pins the intended identity at unity, and the factor of 2 is
  applied in the carrier reconstruction. All three notes are codified
  as clean-room errata entries (`docs/audio/ac3/ac3-errata.md` E2 /
  E1 / E3 respectively; E3 also records that the ETSI TS 102 366
  V1.4.1 copy omits the enhanced-coupling channel-processing clause
  entirely, so A/52:2018 is the operative text). The E3 correction is
  regression-pinned in both directions: a decode-side least-squares
  identity fit (corrected chain gain 1.0 vs exactly 0.5 as printed)
  and a full encode→decode bitstream round-trip gating the aggregate
  coupling-region energy within ±1.5 dB of unity (the as-printed
  reading sits at −6.02 dB). A real Dolby-encoded `ecplinu = 1`
  stream remains a recorded fixture GAP
  (`docs/audio/ac3/fixtures/eac3-ecpl-enhanced-coupling/GAP.md`), so
  ecpl validation stays in-tree round-trip + spec-text.

  **Fractional syncframes** (§E.2.3.1.5 `numblkscod` 0/1/2, Table
  E2.4 — `eac3::make_encoder_with_blocks` / the `blocks` option =
  `1`/`2`/`3`/`6`): a syncframe carries 1, 2, or 3 audio blocks with
  the byte budget scaled by nblks/6 (unchanged bit rate), the
  §E.2.3.1.64 `convsync` flag marking each 6-block AC-3
  conversion-group head (surfaced as the typed `Eac3Bsi::convsync`),
  Table E1.3's implicit `expstre = 1` / `ahte = 0` + explicit
  `convexpstre` audfrm arms, and `blkstrtinfoe` absent on 1-block
  frames. Works across every layout including the 7.1 indep+dep pair;
  AHT is spec-implicit-off and SPX / enhanced coupling stay 6-block
  scope. Guard rails: a construction-time minimum-rate floor (fixed
  syntax + D45 exponent payload + metadata reserve must fit the
  shrunken frame), budget-aware D45 anchor demotion, and a worst-case
  full-scale-noise dry-run through the real emission pipeline at
  construction. Round-trips walk every frame's BSI syntax (numblkscod
  / frmsiz / convsync cadence) and gate decode alignment against the
  6-block encode of the same PCM (r454 figures, taken before the r457
  exponent-sharing bound: ~24-28 dB for 3-block, ~24 dB 2-block,
  ~13 dB for the 1-block extreme — the honest overhead-amortisation
  cost of re-anchoring exponents every 256·nblks samples); the
  external decoder binary accepts all three shapes (r454: stereo
  3/2-block @ 192 kbps at 23.4 / 26.0 dB vs the same harness's
  22.3 dB 6-block baseline, 1-block @ 384 kbps at 62.0 dB). Implementing the round-trip flushed out a decoder
  conformance bug: the Annex E BSI parser read `convsync` / `blkid` /
  `frmsizecod` inside the informational-metadata block, but Table
  E1.2 places them OUTSIDE `if (infomdate)` — a fractional-frame
  stream without an infomd block desynced the BSI tail by 1 bit
  (fixed; `frmsizecod` is now also gated on `blkid`).

  **Transient pre-noise processing emission** (§3.7 / §2.3.2.21-23 —
  `eac3::make_encoder_with_tpnp` / the `tpnp` option): per frame and
  per fbw channel the encoder runs the §3.7.1 transient-location
  analysis (4-sample group-energy onset detector against a
  running-average reference) and emits `transproce` +
  `chintransproc[ch]` + `transprocloc[ch]` (frame-relative, 4-sample
  units) + `transproclen[ch]` — the time-scaling length, set to the
  pre-noise gap between the containing coding block's leading edge
  and the transient (exactly the region the decoder's §3.7.2
  synthesis overwrites; the precise length analysis is encoder
  tuning — Figure E3.2 is the spec's only sketch). Long transforms
  are forced while TPNP is on (the tool corrects long-transform
  pre-noise; block switching avoids it instead), and transient-free
  frames emit `transproce = 0`, byte-identical to the baseline
  encoder. Validated: audfrm parse-back pins loc (±4 groups) and len
  exactly on 6-block and fractional frames, options-vs-typed
  byte-identical, end-to-end decode through our own §3.7.2 synthesis,
  a TPNP corruption sweep, and the external decoder binary accepts
  the syntax (27.4 dB on impulse-train content).

### CRC

§7.10.1 CRC-16 (poly 0x8005), shared between the encoder (forward
generation, augmented form for crc2) and the opt-in decoder residue
check.

## Conformance corpus

`tests/docs_corpus.rs` decodes the AC-3 / E-AC-3 fixture set under
`docs/audio/ac3/fixtures/` (each a raw elementary stream paired with a
reference PCM decode) and scores per-channel PSNR. The decode is
floating-point in the IMDCT, so it is not bit-exact against the
reference, but it is **deterministic** (identical PSNR run-to-run).

Fixtures whose decode is known-good are gated at a `Tier::MinPsnr`
floor so a regression fails CI; the rest log deltas without gating:

| Tier | AC-3 | E-AC-3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MinPsnr` (CI-gated) | 11 fixtures — mono / stereo / 2/1 / 3/0 / 3/2 (±LFE) at 48 / 44.1 / 32 kHz, 32-448 kbps, ~86-92 dB (80 dB floor, 96 kbps mono at 78), plus the torture-grade `ac3-low-bitrate-32kbps-mono` (~62 dB — the 32 kbps lossy / onset-overlap floor — at a loose 50 dB gross-regression floor) | 6 fixtures — stereo + 5.1 + 256-coeff at ~91 dB (80 dB floor), plus the low-rate `eac3-low-bitrate-32kbps` (~66 dB, 60 dB floor) and `eac3-low-rate-stereo-64kbps` (~72 dB, 65 dB floor) as gross-regression guards |

Every corpus fixture is now CI-gated; none remain `ReportOnly`. The
decoder is additionally fuzzed for panic-safety against
truncation / bit-flip / sync-prefixed-garbage corruption of every
fixture (`tests/robustness.rs`), and metadata- / SPX- / ecpl- /
TPNP-bearing encoder outputs join the same three corruption families.

## Fuzzing

`fuzz/` carries six coverage-guided libfuzzer harnesses (daily CI
runs via the `Fuzz` workflow; corpora seed from the fixture set):

- **`parse_headers`** — syncinfo + base-AC-3 BSI + Annex E BSI on raw
  bytes, incl. the metadata opt-in chains and the fractional-frame
  `convsync` tail.
- **`decode_frames`** — the registry AC-3 / E-AC-3 packet → PCM path,
  multiple carved packets on one stateful decoder.
- **`eac3_substream_walk`** — a persistent `Eac3DecoderState` over
  syncinfo-split syncframes: substream accumulation + §E.3.8.2
  chanmap channel combination.
- **`joc_oamd_parse`** — the TS 103 420 JOC/OAMD metadata surface
  (added with the #15 JOC contribution): EC-3 Extension Type A
  signalling, the EMDF container walk with its sparse / dense
  Huffman matrix decode, the standalone OAMD object-element decoder,
  and the QMF object reconstruction + stereo renderer on every
  container that parses (corpus seeded with synthetic valid EMDF).
- **`encode_decode_roundtrip`** — structure-aware differential
  testing: a fuzz-picked contract-valid configuration (layout × rate
  × blocks × SPX/AHT/ecpl/TPNP × metadata) encodes arbitrary PCM and
  every emitted packet must decode through our own decoder with the
  exact sample count.
- **`ac3_encode_decode_roundtrip`** (r457) — the base-AC-3 twin:
  layout × Table 5.18 rate × sample rate × §5.4.2 metadata words
  through the registry path, encode → our AC-3 decoder with exact
  1536-sample frame counts.

The round-trip target found (and r454 fixed) three encoder
bit-budget-overflow classes on construction-accepted configs: a
metadata-blind minimum-rate floor, SNR tuners whose no-fit path
returned the default (overflowing) allocation, and tool syntax that
cannot fit its frame at all — now rejected by a construction-time
worst-case dry-run. r454 campaign (bounded local runs, ~20 min per
target, rss-limited): `parse_headers` 218.3M execs (182k/s, +167
corpus units), `decode_frames` 3.59M execs (+7,420 units),
`eac3_substream_walk` 2.85M execs (+2,041 units),
`encode_decode_roundtrip` 7.5K full encode→decode configs (+371
units) — zero outstanding findings. r457 (three bounded ≤ 300 s runs
over the new encoder paths): the new AC-3 target found two
minimum-rate-floor gaps (no floor at all; coupling side-info missing
from it) and a starved frame the optional dba segment lists pushed
one bit over, and the E-AC-3 target found the budget guard demoting
an elected second anchor instead of collapsing the frame — all fixed
and pinned, both targets then ran 300 s clean.

## Equal-rate position

`tests/equal_rate.rs` (+ `cargo run --release --example
equal_rate_report`) encodes a deterministic synthetic corpus — speech,
music, transients, a two-tone, pink noise and a 5.1 mix with LFE, all
band-limited to 16 kHz — with our encoder and with the black-box
reference encoder at the same nominal rate, decodes every stream with
**both** our decoder and the reference decoder, and scores worst-channel
SNR plus a mean noise-to-mask ratio (the §7.2.2 parametric mask
evaluated on the source's MDCT). The test pins our position and the
distance to the reference; the table is the r457 ladder (3 s clips,
worst-channel SNR in dB through the reference decoder; "r454" is the
same binary with the exponent-sharing bound disabled — the position
the previous round's two-tone table hid behind an aliased lag search).

| clip / kbps | AC-3 r454 | AC-3 r457 | AC-3 reference | E-AC-3 r457 | E-AC-3 reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| speech 64 / 96 / 192 | 9.3 / 10.4 / 11.1 | 11.1 / 16.8 / 29.5 | 13.9 / 19.3 / 32.8 | 11.2 / 16.8 / 29.4 | 13.9 / 18.1 / 30.3 |
| music 96 / 192 / 384 | 10.5 / 11.8 / 11.9 | 17.8 / 33.4 / 51.1 | 29.4 / 34.0 / 50.9 | 17.3 / 31.3 / 48.3 | 27.5 / 33.7 / 50.7 |
| transients 96 / 192 / 384 | 7.8 / 8.6 / 8.7 | 12.6 / 20.5 / 25.4 | 14.9 / 22.7 / 37.5 | 11.7 / 19.4 / 33.5 | 14.8 / 21.9 / 35.3 |
| two-tone 96 / 192 / 384 | 11.5 / 12.0 / 12.0 | 40.3 / 61.2 / 74.3 | 11.8 / 62.5 / 76.8 | 35.0 / 59.5 / 77.8 | 11.8 / 62.7 / 76.5 |
| pink 96 / 192 / 384 | 3.9 / 8.5 / 10.0 | 4.7 / 14.0 / 20.1 | 7.5 / 14.6 / 24.4 | 4.0 / 12.1 / 22.0 | 7.5 / 14.8 / 22.7 |
| 5.1 mix 256 / 448 / 640 | 9.2 / 10.2 / 10.4 | 12.9 / 21.9 / 24.4 | 15.5 / 23.3 / 29.5 | 12.6 / 20.7 / 27.1 | 14.5 / 22.2 / 28.0 |

Per-tool deltas measured while landing (ours → ours, 2 s clips):

- **Exponent-sharing bound** (the r454 defect): a REUSE block whose
  coefficient outgrew its anchor's exponent had its mantissa clamped
  at ±1 — every rate sat at ≈ 12 dB. Mono 440 Hz sine 11.2 → 76.4 dB;
  speech/192 11.1 → 29.5; music/192 11.8 → 33.0; two-tone/192 12.0 → 51.7.
- **Cadence + strategy election** (vs the fixed D15-on-blocks-0/3
  pattern): two-tone/96 20.9 → 40.4, two-tone/192 58.3 → 65.5,
  music/96 11.2 → 18.2, speech/192 28.4 → 29.4, transients/192 21.1 →
  21.7, 5.1/448 20.0 → 22.6; the tight cells (64-96 kbps, 5.1 at
  256 kbps) sit within 1 dB of a single-anchor frame.
- **Seven-bin LFE**: 5.1/448 LFE channel 20.1 → 29.9 dB (reference 34.6).
- **Joint block switching + §8.2.9 dither**: 5.1/448 through the
  reference decoder 21.0 → 21.2 dB and the two decoders' reading of
  our stream narrows from 1.9 to 1.1 dB mean.
- **§7.2.2.1.1** (all SNR offsets zero → `bap[] = 0`): a decode-side
  conformance fix in both decoders and the allocator — a frame the
  tuner floors no longer packs mantissas the reference decoder does
  not read.

What still separates us from the reference (recorded follow-ups, in
order of size): the low-rate coupling strategy (music at 96 kbps
−11.6 dB; the coupling begin/band structure/coordinate cadence are
fixed at `cplbegf = 8` / paired sub-bands / block-0 refresh), transient
coding at high rates (AC-3 transients/384 −12 dB — the short-block
path and per-block offset redistribution stop scaling above 192 kbps),
noise-like content (pink −1..−4 dB) and the 5.1 surround/centre balance
(−1.4..−5 dB). AHT now codes stationary content 2-23 dB *below* the
standard path (its tuner never received the exponent bound) and is a
follow-up of its own. The reference decoder accepts every stream shape
this encoder emits at these rates; the sole residual decoder
disagreement is a block in which the channels' `blksw` flags differ
(the reference corrupts the unswitched channel's overlap region — the
joint policy keeps our streams out of that case).
